# Description

üìå Command-Line Calculator (Python)

This project is a modular, professional-grade command-line calculator application built in Python. It emphasizes clean architecture, error handling, testing, and continuous integration with GitHub Actions.

‚ú® Features

- REPL Interface: Interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for continuous calculations.

- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and modulo.

- Calculation Management: Uses a CalculationFactory to create calculation objects and maintains a history of operations.

- Special Commands: help, history, and exit for enhanced user experience.

- Robust Error Handling: Handles invalid input and division/modulo by zero gracefully.

üß© Design Patterns Integration

üß± Factory Pattern

- Creates operation objects dynamically based on user input via the OperationFactory, allowing easy extensibility for new operations.

üîÑ Observer Pattern

- Implements observers to monitor and respond to calculator events such as logging calculation results and auto-saving history changes

üß† Memento Pattern

- Adds undo and redo functionality by saving and restoring the application‚Äôs internal state (calculation history and last result).

üßÆ Strategy Pattern

- Allows interchangeable strategies for operation execution ‚Äî promoting flexible computation logic.

ü™Ñ Facade Pattern

- Provides a simplified interface (Calculator class) that hides complexity from multiple subsystems (operations, observers, mementos, configuration, etc.).

üìä Data Management with pandas

- History Management: Utilizes pandas.DataFrame to store, filter, and manage calculation history in memory.

- Auto-Save & Load: Automatically saves history to CSV files and restores from existing history on startup.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

- Uses .env files and the python-dotenv library to load configuration settings.

- Validates configuration and gracefully handles missing or invalid environment variables.

üß™ Testing

- Unit & Parameterized Tests with pytest for all components.

- 100% Test Coverage enforced via pytest-cov and GitHub Actions.

- Coverage Exceptions: Specific unreachable lines (e.g., pass, continue) marked with # pragma: no cover.

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow runs tests and checks coverage on every push/PR.

- Test coverage 100%.
